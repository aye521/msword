Patterns can optionally be matched “loosely”. When the end of the pattern matches *[^*]*$ (wildcard, no wildcard, wildcard), if the pattern fails, it is also matched as if the last two characters didn’t exist. The goal is to support the legacy *!* syntax, where the !* is optional.

In the action mapping and action results, the wildcard-matched values can be accessed with the token {N} where N is a number from 1 to 9 indicating which wildcard-matched value to substitute. The whole request URI can be accessed with the {0} token.

Also, the action mapping and action result properties will accept wildcard-matched strings in their value attribute, like:

<action name="/edit/*" class="org.apache.struts.webapp.example.Edit{1}Action">
    <param name="id">{1}</param>
    <result>
      <param name="location">/mainMenu.jsp</param>
      <param name="id">{1}</param>
    </result>
</action>
